# `le_exr`

Island Module for importing OpenEXR files

Note: This module contains its dependencies, OpenEXR and IMath as git
submodules. These should get automatically checked out when you
configure an island app that uses `le_exr` as a dependency for the
first time.

If this does not happen automatically you can update these git
submodules manually:

From this current directory, issue the following commands:
```bash 
git submodule init 
git submodule update 
```
